How to use Vagrant for this Project:

- install vagrant, virtualbox and load the Ubuntu image:
    sudo apt-get install vagrant
    sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3
    cd %project_directory%
    vagrant box add precise32 https://vagrantcloud.com/hashicorp/boxes/precise32/versions/1.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box

- to use the VM to start the server now type:
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    export PORT=3000
    node app.js

  vagrant will setup the VM on the first startup (installing all necessary
  programs including all node-modules). you can configure this step by editing
  the bootstrap.sh script. the /vagrant directory on the VM is equal to
  %project_direcotry% on your host system. after that the server is now running
  on http://localhost:3000.

- to shut the VM down simple type:
    vagrant halt

- to reset the VM type:
    vagrant destory
