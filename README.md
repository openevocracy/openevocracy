## Project

Evocracy is a concept to organize democratic decisions using modern technology. The goal is to increase quality of decisions, create a decentralized structure and keep safety and anonymity as far as possible. Additionally there is no authority in terms of admin roles, every user has the same rights.

Discussions are outsourced in small groups, therefore every idea has a chance to be heard and the best ideas will reach higher levels, where less and less people discuss a topic. People are voted in higher levels, based on there knowledge in the topic-specific area and their ability to integrate opposite ideas. Everyone has a new chance in every topic and everyone can be part in every topic, as well as suggest new topics to discuss.
